			<h2>Background</h2> 
			<p>I'm a former software engineer intern at Intuit. I was born and raised in the heart of San Francisco, California. I went to high school at The Urban School of San
				Francisco. I am currently a computer science major at the College of Computer and Information Science
			at Northeastern University.</p>
			<h2>Computer Science</h2>
			<p>I became interested in computer science through playing video games, as they made me want to create my own video games. As I explored the field in high school and college, I discovered I really enjoy the logic that goes into creating programs and solving problems using code. I've also always enjoyed creating and seeing a finished product and computer science and programming makes that easy for me as I have all the resources I need on my computer.
